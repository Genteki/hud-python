The `hud.job` module provides the Job class and functions for working with collections of trajectories.

# Module Functions

## fetch

```python
async def fetch(filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> List[Job]:
    ...
```

Lists jobs, optionally filtered by metadata.

**Parameters:**
- `filters` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Metadata filters to apply

**Returns:**
- `List[Job]`: A list of jobs matching the filters

## Classes

## Job

The `Job` class represents a collection of related trajectories. Jobs should be created using the `create` class method rather than being constructed directly.

### Class Methods

#### create

```python
@classmethod
async def create(cls, name: str, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Job:
    ...
```

Creates a new job.

**Parameters:**
- `name` (str): The name of the job
- `metadata` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Metadata for the job

**Returns:**
- `Job`: The created job

#### get

```python
@classmethod
async def get(cls, job_id: str) -> Job:
    ...
```

Retrieves a job by its ID.

**Parameters:**
- `job_id` (str): The ID of the job to retrieve

**Returns:**
- `Job`: The retrieved job

### Instance Methods

#### load_trajectories

```python
async def load_trajectories(self) -> List[Trajectory]:
    ...
```

Loads the trajectories associated with this job.

**Returns:**
- `List[Trajectory]`: The trajectories in the job

### Properties

- `id` (str): Unique identifier for the job
- `name` (str): Name of the job
- `created_at` (datetime): When the job was created
- `completed_at` (datetime, optional): When the job was completed
- `status` (str): Status of the job (e.g., "running", "completed", "error")
- `metadata` (Dict[str, Any]): Metadata associated with the job
