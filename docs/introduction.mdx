## Overview

HUD provides an interface for:

* Creating and running evaluation environments for browser and computer use agents

* Recording agent interactions through detailed trajectories

* Managing evaluation jobs across multiple tasks

* Supporting different agent adapters

* Providing telemetry to track agent performance

## Key Concepts

* **Environment** - A running instance where an agent can interact with code execution capabilities and built-in telemetry

* **Task** - Configuration for reproducibly creating an evaluation environment with a defined problem statement

* **Trajectory** - Record of agent actions, observations, and environment states during a runthrough

* **Job** - Collection of related trajectories for evaluating agent performance across multiple tasks
