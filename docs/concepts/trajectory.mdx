# Trajectory

A Trajectory represents a complete record of an agent's interactions within an environment. It captures all actions, observations, and environmental states throughout a single runthrough of a task.

## Overview

Trajectories provide a comprehensive view of how an agent interacted with an environment, including:

- Each action taken by the agent
- The observations returned from the environment
- The state of the environment at each step
- Performance metrics and telemetry data
- Final evaluation results

Trajectories are automatically created when an environment session ends, providing a persistent record of agent behavior.

## Key Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique identifier for the trajectory |
| `task_id` | ID of the task that was performed |
| `job_id` | ID of the job this trajectory belongs to |
| `actions` | Array of all actions taken by the agent |
| `observations` | Array of all observations from the environment |
| `states` | Array of environment states at each step |
| `evaluation` | Final evaluation results for the trajectory |
| `created_at` | Timestamp of when the trajectory was created |
| `duration` | Total duration of the interaction in seconds |

## Working with Trajectories

Trajectories can be retrieved after environment interaction:

```python
import hud
from hud import gym

async def main():
    # Create an environment and run an agent
    job = await hud.Job.create(name="example-job")
    env = gym.make("OSWorld-Ubuntu", job_id=job.id)
    
    # Run your agent in the environment...
    # ...
    
    # After completion, retrieve the trajectory
    trajectory = await env.get_trajectory()
    
    # Access trajectory data
    print(f"Trajectory ID: {trajectory.id}")
    print(f"Number of steps: {len(trajectory.actions)}")
    print(f"Final evaluation: {trajectory.evaluation}")
    
    # Generate a video of the interaction
    video_url = await trajectory.get_video()
    print(f"Video available at: {video_url}")
```

## Analyzing Trajectories

Trajectories provide rich data for analysis and debugging:

```python
async def analyze_trajectory(trajectory_id):
    # Load a specific trajectory by ID
    trajectory = await hud.Trajectory.get(trajectory_id)
    
    # Analyze step-by-step interactions
    for i, (action, observation) in enumerate(zip(trajectory.actions, trajectory.observations)):
        print(f"Step {i}:")
        print(f"  Agent action: {action}")
        print(f"  Environment observation: {observation.text[:50]}...")
        
    # Extract performance metrics
    completion_time = trajectory.duration
    success_rate = trajectory.evaluation.get("success", False)
    efficiency_score = trajectory.evaluation.get("efficiency_score", 0)
    
    return {
        "completion_time": completion_time,
        "success_rate": success_rate,
        "efficiency_score": efficiency_score
    }
```

## Best Practices

- Use trajectories for debugging agent behavior
- Compare trajectories from different versions of your agent to measure improvement
- Generate videos from trajectories to visually inspect agent behavior
- Store trajectory IDs to reference past runs and create benchmarks
