<Warning>
This feature is experimental and still in development. APIs and functionality may change.
</Warning>

The `hud mcp` command turns HUD's debugging and analysis capabilities into MCP tools for use with Cursor and other MCP clients.

## Synopsis

```bash
hud mcp
```

## Available Tools

- `debug_environment` - Run debug checks on MCP environments
- `analyze_environment` - Discover tools and capabilities  
- `test_tool` - Execute specific tools for testing

## Cursor Setup

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hud-cli": {
      "command": "hud",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor and use natural language:
```
Debug my Docker environment called my-env:latest
Analyze what tools are available in browser-env
```

## Claude Desktop Setup

<Tab title="macOS">
```json
// ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hud-cli": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/hud",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
```json
// %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hud-cli": {
      "command": "C:\\Python311\\Scripts\\hud.exe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage Example

```
You: Debug my browser automation environment

Cursor: I'll help debug that. Let me check your environment.

*Calls debug_environment({ image: "browser-env:latest" })*

Cursor: The environment is failing at phase 3. Let me analyze the available tools...
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Not starting**: Check HUD is installed with `which hud`
- **No response**: Ensure `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is set
- **Docker errors**: Verify Docker is running and accessible
