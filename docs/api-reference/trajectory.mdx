# hud.trajectory

The `hud.trajectory` module provides the Trajectory class for working with task execution records.

## Classes

### Trajectory

The `Trajectory` class represents a record of a task execution, including actions, observations, and evaluations. Trajectories are typically accessed via the `load` class method or through `Job.load_trajectories()` rather than being constructed directly.

#### Class Methods

##### load

```python
@classmethod
async def load(cls, trajectory_id: str) -> Trajectory:
    ...
```

Loads a trajectory by its ID.

**Parameters:**
- `trajectory_id` (str): The ID of the trajectory to load

**Returns:**
- `Trajectory`: The loaded trajectory

#### Instance Methods

##### get_video

```python
async def get_video(self) -> bytes:
    ...
```

Retrieves the video recording of the trajectory.

**Returns:**
- `bytes`: The video data

#### Properties

- `id` (str): Unique identifier for the trajectory
- `task_id` (str): ID of the task that was executed
- `job_id` (str): ID of the job the trajectory belongs to
- `actions` (List[Any]): List of actions taken during the trajectory
- `observations` (List[Observation]): List of observations received during the trajectory
- `states` (List[Any]): List of environment states during the trajectory
- `evaluation` (float): Evaluation score for the trajectory
- `created_at` (datetime): When the trajectory was created
- `duration` (float): Duration of the trajectory in seconds
