# Environment

An `Environment` in the HUD SDK represents a running instance where an agent can interact with a task. It provides methods for observation, action, and built-in telemetry to record the agent's interactions.

## Overview

Environments are the core runtime instances where agents perform tasks. Key features include:

- Gymnasium-compatible interface for agent interaction
- Built-in telemetry to record actions and observations
- Methods to evaluate agent performance
- Support for video generation of agent interactions
- Automatic trajectory creation for later analysis

## Initialization

Environments are created using the gym module:

```python
import hud
from hud import gym

# Create a job to group related trajectories
job = await hud.Job.create(name="example-job")

# Create an environment instance
env = gym.make("OSWorld-Ubuntu", job_id=job.id)

# Wait for environment to be ready
await env.wait_for_ready()

# Load a task and reset the environment
task = await hud.Task.get("osworld_task_id")
observation = await env.reset(task_id=task.id)
```

## Key Methods

The `Environment` class provides several key methods:

### Reset

Resets the environment to a specific task:

```python
observation = await env.reset(task_id="task-123", metadata={"agent_version": "1.0"})
```

### Step

Takes an action in the environment and returns the new state:

```python
observation, reward, terminated, info = await env.step(action)
```

### Evaluate

Evaluates the current task:

```python
result = await env.evaluate()
```

### Get Trajectory

Retrieves the trajectory record of the agent's interactions:

```python
trajectory = await env.get_trajectory()
video_url = await trajectory.get_video()
```

### Close

Closes the environment:

```python
await env.close()
```

## Observations

Observations from the environment include:

* `screenshot`: A base64-encoded PNG image of the current screen
* `text`: Text observation from the environment
* `state`: Additional state information specific to the environment type

## Environment States

An environment can be in one of several states:

* `creating`: The environment is being created
* `running`: The environment is running and ready for interaction
* `error`: An error occurred during environment creation or execution
* `closed`: The environment has been closed

## VNC Access

For debugging purposes, you can view the environment directly via VNC:

```python
live_url = await env.get_vnc_url()
print(f"Connect to the environment via VNC at: {live_url}")
```
